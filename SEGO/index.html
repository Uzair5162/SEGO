        <div id="who we are">
            <h3 class="heading">Who We Are</h3>
            <p>We are a student-led initiative to help direct engineering-bound high school students like us into relevent opportunities to expand their interests. We organize trips to engineering workplaces and work with universities to empower youth to pursue careers in engineering. We attend Glenforest Secondary School with a passion for technology, creativity and design and we hope to explore the various careers in fields of interest, as well as gain exposure to workplace responsibilities.
