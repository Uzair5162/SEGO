            <p class="body">SEGO is Ontarioâ€™s own club for passionate and motivated students who wish to learn more about the various fields in the engineering line of work. We are a student-led initiative to help direct engineering-bound high school students like us into relevant opportunities to expand their interests. We organize trips to engineering workplaces and work with universities to empower youth to pursue careers in engineering. We attend Glenforest Secondary School with a passion for technology, creativity and design and we hope to explore the various careers in fields of interest, as well as gain exposure to workplace responsibilities.</p>
